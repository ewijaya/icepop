Installing
----------

ICEPOP is best installed via `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/>`_ through
one of the following commands::

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/ewijaya/icepop.git 
    $ pip install git+https://github.com/ewijaya/icepop.git --upgrade
    $ pip install git+git://github.com/ewijaya/icepop.git
    $ pip install git+git://github.com/ewijaya/icepop.git --upgrade


Dependencies
------------

In order for ICEPOP installation to succeed, you will need the following
primary pieces of software:

    * the Python programming language;
    * the setuptools packaging/installation library.


Python
======
ICEPOP requires `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ version 2.7 or later. Some
caveats and notes about other Python versions.

* We are not planning to support **Python 2.4**
  given its age and the number of useful tools that depends on  **Python 2.7** such as Pandas
  and many other modules.
* ICEPOP has not yet been tested on **Python 3.x** and is very likely to be
  incompatible with that line of development. However, as much as we can,
  we try to be forward-looking (e.g. using ``import __future__``). In the
  future we plan to port to 3.x once our dependencies do.

Source code checkouts
=====================
We manage the project's source code with `Git <https://github.com/>`_  DVCS. 
To follow ICEPOP development via Git instead of downloading official releases,
you can clone the canonical repository straight from ICEPOP's organization 
repository on Github: ``git@github.com:ewijaya/icepop.git``.

ActivePython and PyPM
=====================
ICEPOP is planned to be accessible for Windows users via ActiveState's
`ActivePython <http://www.activestate.com/activepython/downloads>`_.
