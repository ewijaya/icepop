Know the cell population of your data
========================================

ICEPOP (Immune CEll POPulation) is the method for estimating immune 
cell population in the expressed genes. It enable analysis
of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) or raw expression data. 
These APIs and scripts will let you have a fine grained control on the data
analysis lacking in the web version. On top of the
core immune cell population deconvolution, it allows
you to download the raw data from `NCBI GEO
<http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/>`_ gene expression database, normalize, 
and plot the data using command line interface.
